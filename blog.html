		 		<h3 class="ctitle">Probation period for new employee</h3>
		 		<p><csmall>Posted: February 1, 2017.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
		 		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/stick_figures.png"></p><br>
		 		<p>Reading time: <strong>4 minutes</strong></p><br>
				<p>The day when a new member becomes a part of the team and starts contributing is an exciting moment for this person. The newcomer typically  is very enthusiastic and anxious to add value. He / she has new ideas and views. It is critical to see how a prospective partner / teammate will fit in and able to work with the existing team.</p>
				<p><strong>How to avoid the recruiting gamble and be confident about new  hire?</strong></p>
				<p>The probation period is a time of finding out who the person really is. No matter how great the first impression was during the interview, you will not know the true character and behaviours of the person until you worked together for some time. Typically, the probation period of 3-6 months is a good indicator of what to expect from an individual. It is a good portion of time to evaluate the potential and hidden caveats. Based on personal experience, a 2-3 month period is good enough for a person to fully reveal himself/herself.</p>
				<p>Why do you need a probational period? Here are some real startup examples:</p>
				<p><strong>Situation A</strong>: John was a member of the ”Starbucks club” before the startup was even formed. He was discussing the ideas of sipping the hot frappucino and expressing the desire to becoming the head of an as of yet non-existent department.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Initial level of enthusiasm: High.</li>
				    <li>Lasted: 2 months.</li>
				    <li>Reason: one has to do the actual work to earn the title and respect of team members. Ideas without execution mean nothing. John was not able to put his ideas into a realistic plan of action.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Situation B</strong>: Mary joined the startup in the early stage of the project. An intelligent person with full set of professional skills. However, her enthusiasm faded away after a slowdown in workflow as well as having to deal with some personal problems.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Initial level of enthusiasm: High.</li>
				    <li>Lasted: 10 months.</li>
				    <li>Reason: lack of perseverance.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Situation C</strong>: Peter joined the startup several months after the start. A knowledgeable and ambitious person, he tried to incorporate his own ideas into the mainstream. An aggressive approach turned into politicking and backstabbing within the workplace.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Initial level of enthusiasm: Very High.</li>
				    <li>Lasted: 3 months.</li>
				    <li>Reason: execution of personal agenda without considering the team's vision.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The process of hiring a new person is risky, but inevitable. It is dangerous to drive a car, but how else will you get to your destination point? So the smart startup founder will take reasonable precautions to avoid future bad exit situations.</p>
				<p><i>“One cannot hire a hand— the whole man always comes with it”</i>, an old proverb says.</p>
				<p>Steps that will help to evaluate individuals performance and make decisions about their involvement within the team:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li><strong>3 month - time to review a new recruit’s performance and make an evaluation.</strong></li>
				    <li><strong>6 month - time to make a decision if that person should become a fully fledged member or a partner.</strong></li>
				    <li><strong>2 years vesting period - it should help to avoid any unexpected future circumstances in people's lives. The vesting period can be longer or shorter depending on partner's preferences.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Another way is to take your time during the recruiting period and be 100% sure that your candidate will fit in with the team. Drucker, Peter F writes in his “The Effective Executive” book:</p>
				<p><i>Among the effective executives I have had occasion to observe, there have been people who make decisions fast, and people who make them rather slowly. But without exception, they make personnel decisions slowly and they make them several times before they really commit themselves.<br>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., former head of General Motors, the world’s largest manufacturing company, was reported never to make a personnel decision the first time it came up. He made a tentative judgment, and even that took several hours as a rule. Then, a few days or weeks later, he tackled the question again, as if he had never worked on it before. Only when he came up with the same name two or three times in a row was he willing to go ahead. Sloan had a deserved reputation for the “winners” he picked. But when asked about his secret, he is reported to have said: “No secret— I have simply accepted that the first name I come up with is likely to be the wrong name— and I therefore retrace the whole process of thought and analysis a few times before I act.” Yet Sloan was far from a patient man.<br>Few executives make personnel decisions of such impact. But all effective executives I have had occasion to observe have learned that they have to give several hours of continuous and uninterrupted thought to decisions on people if they hope to come up with the right answer.</i></p>
				<p>What do you experience when a new member joins your own team or startup? Is there a probational period?</p>
				<p>Thank you in advance for your feedback!</p>

		 		<h3 class="ctitle">Measure twice! Team’s output formula.</h3>
		 		<p><csmall>Posted: January 24, 2017.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
		 		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/car_factory.png"></p><br>
		 		<p>Reading time: <strong>4 minutes</strong></p><br>
				<p>It is easy to measure activity. Did you ever try to measure an individual’s output in startup, workplace, company? Measure of the company's productivity: revenues/sales and income. Measure of the team’s productivity: projects delivered, met deadlines, and perhaps ability to put up fires or lack of such.</p>
				<p><strong>Let’s tackle measuring individual productivity as it is harder to define: hours, sales, units of sales, tasks, projects, writing an article and a number of readers and etc.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Solution(s) to issues</strong></p>
				<p>Andrew S. Grove, a great CEO of Intel, wrote in his "High Output Management" book:<br>
				<i>"The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than none. But <strong>a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit</strong> and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). The second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing."</i></p>
				<p>Such indicators have many uses. First, they spell out very clearly what the <strong>objectives of an individual or group are</strong>. Second, they provide a <strong>degree of objectivity when measuring an administrative function</strong>. Third, and as important as any, they give us a <strong>measure by which various administrative groups performing the same function in different organizations can be compared with each other</strong>.</p>
				<p>First thing that comes to the mind is  work hours. A person spends 40 hours of work which is  a perfect definition of activity. How do we know if these hours were spent productively? How do you measure that a person delivers work,or spends his day walking back and forth to Starbucks or checking out Facebook? <strong>How do you measure output of the work unit?</strong></p>
				<p>That brings us to measurement: various tasks and work completed that add value to the business. It is defined as creating a  workflow that allows business to be profitable and measurable behavior that keeps the company afloat. It is computed by the <strong>accurate completion of milestones and output delivery</strong>.</p>
				<p>Lets define output for a typical four member team or startup: leader/manager, analyst, developer and sales person.</p>
				<p><strong>1. The Leader / manager</strong></p>
				<p>Successful execution requires significant discipline. There is a high chance that the leader’s vision is focused on key issues. If the leader is able to organize people, processes and workflows, then results will be more likely outstanding.</p>
				<p>The leader role and output is perfectly defined by Andrew S. Grove: <br><i>“We can sum matters up with the proposition that: A manager’s output = The output of his organization (startup or team) + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. The definition of “manager” should be broadened: individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and information should also be seen as middle managers, because they exert great power within the organization. But the key definition here is that the output of a manager is a result achieved by a group either under her supervision or under her influence.”</i></p>
				<p>The leader's output will be measured by productivity of the analyst, the developer and the sales person. It takes an entire team to win.</p>
				<p><strong>2. The Analyst</strong></p>
				<p>A person who is analyzing data, specific  information, developing solutions to business problems, or to advancing a company's sales efforts. A typical equity analyst would be looking into the company's financial information, industry and economic data in order to price securities. Output of such an analyst will be correct price valuations of various companies and frequency of such updates.</p>
				<p><strong>3. The Developer</strong></p>
				<p>Developers specialize in creating applications. They have to write readable code as a courtesy to their colleagues, handle debugging and ensure fast execution of such applications by constantly optimizing and refactoring the code.</p>
				<p><strong>4. The Salesperson</strong></p>
				<p>Such an individual is the easiest to define: a person who sells goods and services to customers. The output is measured by the amount of sales he or she is able to make during a given period. Compensation can be decreased or increased based and directly related on the amount of goods or services sold.</p>
				<p>A tracking method ... ✔... ✔... ✔... gives a good understanding of performance and allows the team to build a sustainable company framework. Summarizing what was said above, these factors are standing out:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Work hours</li>
					<li>Task and projects completion</li>
					<li>Sales unit and dollar volume</li>
					<li>Peer comparison</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The complexity of the measurement involves a human factor as well. It is not just a diligent execution of everyday tasks, but also a proactivity, ability to go beyond the routine, being flexible in decisions and thinking, the ability to focus on the right aspects of the work.</p>
				<p>How do you measure your productivity? Productivity of your team and startup? Will reply within 24 hours.</p>

		 		<h3 class="ctitle">All rivers flow: dynamic approach to splitting your equity shares.</h3>
		 		<p><csmall>Posted: January 15, 2017.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
		 		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/river.png"></p><br>
				<p>Reading time: <strong>3 minutes</strong></p><br>
				<p>All rivers flow, and all rivers change. Do you adapt to an ever-changing state? How do you decide how equity should be split in your company?</p>
				<p>Startups and companies are going through tremendous evolution during the first years of their existence. It can completely overhaul and change ideas, focus, working style, product and even founders. Speaking geometrically, a triangle can literally take the shape of  a cube in the entrepreneurial world. How does one decide how to deal with an equity split  in such conditions?</p>
				<p><i>Seasoned entrepreneur Jason S. states: Equity split is based on the value and time that each person brings to the table. Value is based on cash invested and how much income they could make in a relevant position as an employee in another company. I.e. a software engineer should get more ownership than an executive assistant all else being equal.</i></p>
				<p>There are two options of tracking value and equity allocation: <strong>Fixed</strong> and <strong>Dynamic</strong>. Take a look at both approaches in greater detail.</p>
				<p><strong>(1) Fixed approach</strong> gets every single member a fixed amount of shares. For example, three founders split the  company's ownership according to some logic and it is 40%, 35% and 25%. Then they bring someone new into the company, his or her amount of shares is set in stone according to the position. Possibly 5%. Then this share has to be taken from existing shareholders thereby diluting the share held. Perhaps it will be 38%, 33%, 24% and 5%.</p>
				<p><strong>(2) Dynamic approach</strong> allocation will convert members productivity and contribution into Equity Share ownership. This approach takes into consideration many factors on an ongoing basis, as often as weekly or monthly as follows:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Hours worked</li>
				    <li>Milestones completed</li>
				    <li>Cash invested and contributed</li>
				    <li>Hours worked converted based on the person’s market value (compensation)</li>
				    <li>Ownership decreases or increases based on individual contribution</li>
				    <li>Shares of those who leave the company will be diluted over time to other members</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The team is able to vote to determine successful completion of the tasks (in monthly reviews).</p>
				<p>Your shares will decrease if you procrastinate, and increase, if your performance is above average. It will allow your company to be at the peak performance and fair towards its members.</p>
				<p>Here is the real story:<br><i>A startup owner  hires a CEO that gets fired 6 months later due to simply not showing up and doing his job. It was stated in the documents that he gets X% of the company shares irrespective of changes or fixed allocation. They made a mistake in this agreement, because the amount was large enough to control the company even though this  CEO was no longer part of it. 
The owner had to engage lawyers to take control of the situation which means completely wasted time and money.</i></p>
				<p>What would have happened if they used a dynamic approach?</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
					    <li>They would have a good understanding of every member's performance from day one including this particular individual. Each person starts with zero ownership and only ongoing contribution will translate into shares ownership over time.</li>
					    <li>If this CEO contributed at the beginning and then stopped contributing,  the amount of shares would have decreased to none at this point.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>This problem can be prevented from ever coming up in the first place. Nobody wants to pay for nothing, don't you agree?</p>
				<p>We are curious to hear your equity ownership situation stories. Did you have similar issues and if you did, how did you  resolve them? Do you use a specific system that works for you?</p>

		 		<h3 class="ctitle">Jack of all trades or specialist - What is my responsibility in the startup?</h3>
		 		<p><csmall>Posted: December 31, 2016.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
		 		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/dontknow.jpg"></p><br>
				<p>Reading time: <strong>3 minutes</strong></p><br>
				<p>The holidays are coming with the smell of ginger cookies and the aroma of pine trees. 
It is a good time to relax, enjoy a cup of hot tea, think about what goals to achieve and what to focus your team on during next year.</p>
				<p>What are the responsibilities of the king?</p>
				<p>Who??? Yes, you heard it right.</p>
				<p>The person who governs his kingdom and decides whether to declare a war or sign a peace treaty. Isn't it what exactly happens when you get a big C-type title?</p>
				<p>Freedom comes with self-formulated rules, discipline and clearly outlined responsibilities.You know now what your boss felt when you were just an employee on your previous job. He had to keep it running 7 days a week, thinking about short time goals and long time perspectives. It's your turn to be the boss.</p>
				<p>
					Here are our blocks of recommendations:
					<ul>
						<li>You can be the expert. Perhaps you are the Michael Jordan of programming, and have 100% focus on one type of work. Or you can have 3-5 different skills with around 70-80% of the expected professional expertise knowledge in each skill and become a generalist. Understand what works better for you and your teammates. Most company founders are excellent generalists.</li>
						<li>Stick to your expertise, and always be ready to help your partner and expand your knowledge. Each person has certain skill sets and inclinations. It's reasonable to assign work to the person who will quickly deliver quality work in a certain field.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you are a generalist or specialist certain rules are universal:
					<ul>
						<li>Own the project. Own your work. Concentrate all your abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or promotion. Do your work. Let your results speak for you.</li>
						<li>Have a clear understanding of how your application and your business will be working. It will make your everyday decisions and work prioritization easier.</li>
						<li>Think of the long term impact while working on your assignment. Design and outline the architecture of the whole project before starting to work on your assignment.</li>
						<li>Set reasonable weekly tasks. Deliver them and review what was done at the end of the week.</li>
						<li>Be ready to work extra hours and be flexible to work when time is available. As Benjamin Disraeli said: “Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action”.</li>
						<li>It's not only adding new work that adds results. The elimination of non-essentials from your “to-do-list” is a vital factor in great achievement. Do what is essential — because most of what we say and do is not essential. Focus on work that matters and produces results. Nothing is worth doing pointlessly.</li>
						<li>Don`t be afraid to learn new concepts. Implement new technologies. Why not if it saves time and makes your product better.</li>
						<li>Even if it goes against the mainstream of  a typical startup. What is a typical startup anyway?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>And, lastly: do not try to behave like a tyrant. Look for your own progress, not others’ mistakes.</p>
				<p>Do not aim for absolute monarchy,  too much  control historically has ended up in  revolution and the overthrowing of the ruling house.</p>
				<p><strong>Are you generalist or specialist? How do you decide what tasks you should be working on?</strong></p>
				<p>Have a warm holiday season!<br>Happy New Year!</p>

				<h3 class="ctitle">Agent provocateur</h3>
				<p><csmall>Posted: December 16, 2016.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/agent.png"></p><br>
				<p>Reading time: <strong>4 minutes</strong></p><br>
				<p>You truly believe everything is under control. Engine just got engaged. Success is inevitable. However, there is one factor you never thought of, the one that can ruin your vessel from inside.</p>
				<p>In our previous post we tried to give startup founders a heads up on basic preparation. We presented a list of checkpoints to set before getting the enterprise going.</p>
				<p>A team’s dynamic can be as follows:</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>there is one person inspired by an idea, the leader (usually the one who created it), with the rest following.</li>
						<li>there can be two or more leaders and the rest are followers</li>
						<li>then there could be a mix and match, of course</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>The followers could also be full of energy and share the vision for the future, but they are not always ready to go all the way. So what are your agent provocateurs, or provoking agents?
				</p>
				<p><em>[<strong>provocateur</strong>. Noun. (plural <strong>provocateurs</strong>) One who engages in provocative behavior. An undercover agent who incites suspected persons to partake in or commit criminal acts.]</em></p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The momentum is gone.</strong> Once the implementation (or discussion) takes too long, or the idea does not seem to be feasible anymore, their level of enthusiasm lowers down dramatically. There is no focus on important aspects such as keeping customers satisfied with your product, revenue growth and constant revisions of what works and what doesn't.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Individuals do not share the same goals and are not open about it.</strong> Another scenario might describe the case when one of the founders follows his own “secret ”plan, different from the one the team originally had agreed on. It results in team members blaming each other which creates a negative atmosphere within the company.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Too many things to focus on.</strong> Your third obstacle is a lack of focus. Not following the implementation plan, a desire to fix it all at the same time, or randomly switching topics is a symptom for this disease. There are too many things that have to be done. Focusing and eliminating non-essential distractions can allow your startup to survive and prosper.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Not having a clear framework of how everyone gets paid and rewarded.</strong> There are many examples when people cannot agree on their contributions and their equity share which results in heated discussions or even arguments while there is no focus on product building.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>What are the fundamental remedies? We recommend you to consider the following:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>An excellent team is the core element and should be the key pillar for a great startup and the leadership base of a future company. You would start looking for team members from your inner circle:
							<ul>
								<li>colleagues</li>
								<li>reliable business partners</li>
								<li>friends</li>
								<li>and possibly relatives</li>
							</ul>
							Ideally you should select people you know, someone you can trust.
						</li>
						<li>Try to imagine your future co-owner`s behavior in a very stressful situation. What does it take to make him lose control?  Expect that this is a pattern and it will potentially repeat in the future. Eliminate negative people right away. You can't change them and it will only slow you down.</li>
						<li>Establish a transparent equity sharing framework which is adjusted based on continuous contribution and work by participants.</li>
						<li>How much guidance do other members of the group need? Be clear about it and accept it.</li>
						<li>We all believe in equal partnership, but successful startups have someone who can consolidate the team.</li>
						<li>A company should have a healthy culture, be transparent and avoid talking behind other people's backs.</li>
						<li>The tiniest misunderstandings or issues have to be openly discussed and solved. Make sure to address difficult issues and don't let them build up. This leads to increased conflicts later.</li>
						<li>Plan your development as a company and follow it accordingly. Long term goals are made of 3-5 year plans. 3-5 year plans are made of 1 year plans which are made of 1-3 month plans. Success can be reached by making small and focused achievements.</li>
					</ul>

		 		<h3 class="ctitle">Minus one: your partner left the company.</h3>
		 		<p><csmall>Posted: December 11, 2016.</csmall> | <csmall2>By: Sergei Stadnik</csmall2></p><br>
		 		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/blog/coffee.jpg"></p><br>
				<p>Reading time: <strong>2 minutes</strong></p><br>
		 		<p>Remember the time, when  you enjoyed a cup of coffee with your partner, discussing the exponential growth of the company?</p>
		 		<p>One Person might no longer be interested in the project, disagreeing on how things have to be done, have no time to allocate to business or might be fired. Your partner put time and money in the business, or even brought some equipment that is essential to the company. Now they want it back, or at least a portion of it.</p>
		 		<p>
		 			<ol>
		 			    <li>How do you handle such a conversation?</li>
		 			    <li>How do you prevent this situation? Or make it smooth?</li>
		 			    <li>What do you do about money and time invested?</li>
		 			</ol>
		 		</p>
		 		<p>Remember each situation is different and has to be approached accordingly. To be ready for that, here is the list of things you prepare for yourself as a business owner and your partner prior to starting working together:</p>
		 		<p>
		 			<ol>
		 			    <li>It is a very unpleasant conversation you might face if this unhappy eventuality was never discussed. Be direct, polite and fair. Many people cannot handle such a conversation, so it's up to you to do it well, be clear, honest and  transparent. Manage it as if you have to work with this person again. Think long term and don't avoid it.</li>
		 			    <li>Plan for it and discuss it. Most importantly, work with people who can have an open mind, are ethical in business (read: you can trust) and able to handle such a situation logically. Good staff  is the best asset that the company can have. Start-up companies are moving fast, change fast and adopt change.  Work with people who can move and learn as fast as well.</li>
		 			    <li>It is a good idea not to just discuss, but confirm those statements in writing to avoid future misunderstanding. Will all partners be putting an equal amount of money into the project? Are the finances spent non-refundable? How much time are you willing to allocate? What about your team? What if the company needs to continue using the finances?  Are there possible rental or buyout options?</li>
		 			</ol>
		 		</p>
		 		<p>These are some measures that can be taken at the beginning of a venture to establish ground rules and procedures to follow:</p>
		 		<p>
		 			<ul>
		 			    <li>Discuss what is going to happen if someone leaves the team after the first day since the start-up was founded or the first day since they joined</li>
		 			    <li>Sign a contract</li>
		 			    <li>Establish a vesting period of 2 years and if the person leaves prior to that deadline they forfeit their share</li>
		 			    <li>Should the company compensate a quitting team member if the person did not contribute financially?</li>
		 			    <li>Should time invested, ideas and intellectual property be considered company property?</li>
		 			    <li>Supplies and equipment becomes company property</li>
		 			    <li>If equity was calculated using cash multipliers (4x multiplier) then discount cash to its original value. If possible then return the cash contributed back to the person leaving your team</li>
		 			    <li>For how long should a quitting member have the right to buy equity back</li>
		 			    <li>Remember that the startup will have no obligations to any person who leaves the team</li>
		 			    <li>The important aspect is to be fair to everyone</li>
		 			</ul>
		 		</p>
		 		<p>It is important to understand that the company is losing other assets as well, not only the person who is leaving the company. It is slowing business growth and development until a newly recruited person joins the team. Then it takes time to orientate and settle the new person, establish a working relationship and mutual goals and objectives.</p>
		 		<p>What would you add to the list? Please share your thoughts.</p>

				<p>Reading time: <strong>1 minute</strong></p><br>
		 		<p>After talking to numerous entrepreneurs we discovered that equity sharing is an ongoing problem and several recurring headaches stand out :</p>
		 		<!-- <p> -->
		 			<ul>
		 				<li>Startups fail before launching their product</li>
		 				<li>Most new companies are facing this issue</li>
		 				<li>There is no comprehensive and direct solution to address it</li>
		 			</ul>
		 		<!-- </p> -->
		 		<p>We experienced it ourselves and at first we could not find a straightforward approach on how to split equity between the team members.</p>
		 		<p>Cohesive Bits is a team of passionate professionals and friends who are working on defining equity share among members of startup companies. Our goal is to create an application that  measures your team members’ productivity and help you slice the pie according to every member’s contribution.</p>
		 		<p>We would like to hear you opinion on this topic. At what point in your company's development did the question of equity sharing come up? What was the toughest topic to discuss and the most difficult issue to solve? Please share your stories.</p>
